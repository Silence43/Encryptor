If you have some prying eyes on your computer, but just setting the file to hidden isn't enough, this sure will. 
Because of how ridiculously simple this batch file is, I put it in the public domain.
You can read the license if you want, but to summarize it in a sentence or two,
you can do absolutely whatever you want with it, but I don't claim that this is a 100% safe file, even though I try to make sure it
is.
